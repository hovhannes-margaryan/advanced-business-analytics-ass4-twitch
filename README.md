# Advanced Business Analytics Assignment Twitch

We have a grasp of what type of tags and games are common amongst banned streamers.
The effect of being part of a squad has been explored as well for banned streamers and the higher
number of followers for non‐banned streamers part of a squad. As we can see there are a lot of
possible methods to analyze the data and we only looked at the tip of the iceberg for the scope of
this assignment. Additionally, the following hypothesis was formally proposed and tested: being in
a squad results more number of followers and engagement.
To address the issue of class imbalance within the dataset, propensity weighting technique was
applied. This approach enabled the dataset to effectively answer the hypothesis by mitigating the
impact of imbalanced data.
t‐test was performed to provide a conclusive answer to the hypothesis. The null hypothesis, suggesting
that streamers in squads do not experience more followers, was rejected based on the results of
the statistical analysis. Thus, streamers who belong to squads indeed exhibit a higher number of
followers.
