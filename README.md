# Advanced Business Analytics Assignment Twitch

The live streaming platform Twitch is widely used and encompasses various content categories, such
as video games, music, art, talk shows, and more. Streamers are provided with the capability to
broadcast their live gameplay, creative endeavors, or other activities to a global audience. For this
project, a dataset from Twitch is provided, which includes information about streamers, their squad
membership (if applicable), tags, games, and more.

In this section, the focus is on investigating the hypothesis that more followers are experienced by
streamers who belong to squads. The idea of such a hypothesis that streamers in a squad experince
collaboration, networking and squad branding. First, the number of followers of a streamer is chosen
as a metric to address the hypothesis. Next, data exploration and analysis are conducted on the
Twitch dataset using Cypher. The dataset is subjected to propensity weighting techniques as a solution
for addressing class imbalance, enabling the dataset to be used to answer the hypothesis effectively.
Furthermore, a statistical test is performed to answer the hypothesis conclusively. The null hypothesis,
which claims that streamers who belong to squads do not experience more followers, is rejected
based on the statistical analysis. The results provide evidence supporting the notion that streamers
who belong to squads indeed experience a higher number of followers.
